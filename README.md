## Machine learning based Cat vs Dog
Algorithm predicts defined image "is dog or cat?" using Tensorflow backend. This project is insipired by sentdex's tutorial. 

## Usage
First, you need to install needed libraries.

For first time:
```python
python train.py -o normal
```
For training existing model:
```python
python train.py -o train
```
For classificate an image:
```python
python classification.py -i imagename
```
